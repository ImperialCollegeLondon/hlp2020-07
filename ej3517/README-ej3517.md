# Sample Individual Statement for Individual Code Submission

This sample project contains a single F# sample module with uninspiring name `CombinatorRuntimeModule.fs`.

It uses `Dotnet Core 3.1`, with dependency on `Expecto.Fscheck`.

My login is `tomcl` and it is used:

* In `ej3517` directory under which this project is put
* As project (and solution) `ej3515.fsproj`, `ej3517.sol`
* As second part of `README-ej3517` name

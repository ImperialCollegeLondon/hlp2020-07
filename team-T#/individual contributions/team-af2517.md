# AF2517 - Individual Contributions
- Wrote the parser module (most of the module was written during the individual phase).
- Parsing of built in functions
- Parsing of lists into nested built-in type Pair in an F# style
- Parsing of recursive functions into normal functions using the Y combinator 
- Parsing of mutually recursive functions into a touple of lists of function names and lists of lambdas (the Y combinator is handled by the runtime)

- Left associative function application
- Support for operators + - / *
- Helped adjust the parser to the "match" feature by parsing elements such as {x;y} 
- General debugging of simple cases and edge cases found when testing
- Testing of the parser
- Parsing of anonymous functions 
- Made significant contributions to merging the three modules (lexer, parser and Lambda Runtime).
- Parsing of Lazy keyword into an AST element

# DG2217 - Individual Contributions

- Wrote the lambda evaluation runtime module (most of the module was written during the individual phase)
- Added extra features to the lambda rumtime module: Mnemoization of function applications, mutually recursive function execution.
- Helped Vlad (vn1417) integrating the "match" feature with the rest of the runtime.
- Added new in-built functions "Print", "Greater", and "Lower".
- Worked integrating the high-level functions into a function capable of reading text files. The runtime is now able to remember functions and variables declared in each line of the file. 
- Helped the rest of the team writing code in the target language and debugging.

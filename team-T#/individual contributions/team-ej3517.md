* Added extra features to the lambda rumtime module like application of list entries [f(x);g(y)].
<!--* Helped Vlad (vn1417) integrating the "match" feature with the rest of the runtime.
* Added new in-built functions "Print", "Greater", and "Lower".
* Worked integrating the high-level functions into a function capable of reading text files. The runtime is now able to * remember functions and variables declared in each line of the file.
* Helped the rest of the team writing code in the target language and debugging.-->
* Helped the rest of the team to find bugs and limitations to make the language more practical while writing the demo code : asked for new built-in functions like "Greater", possibility of writing nested empty lists, ...
* Wrote most of the functions  demo code in TSHARP (our language): 
  * append lst1 lst2
  * merge lst1 lst2   ;   sort lst1 lst2 
  * List.Reduce lst1 f a 
* Wrote most of the instructions of the language in the README-team.md to ex

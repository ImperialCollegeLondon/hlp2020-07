 

How will your code be used by team (if all goes well) including what order are modules in your team project compiled?

Which parts if any are code written for other people?

Which parts if any of code you use is written by others?

What help have you obtained/given others debugging or doing code review?

How did you work out (who decided what - how do you revise) the types that interface your code with others?

 

I do not want a report-style statement, just the above info as concisely as possible.
